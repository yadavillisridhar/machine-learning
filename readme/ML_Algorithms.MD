Types of machine learning models
There are two types of problems that dominate machine learning: classification and prediction.

                        These problems are approached using models derived from algorithms designed for either classification or regression (a method used for predictive modeling). Occasionally, the same algorithm can be used to create either classification or regression models, depending on how it is trained. 
                        
                        Below you will find a list of popular algorithms used to create classification and regression models. 


Classification models:
                        Logistic regression
                        Naive Bayes
                        Decision trees
                        Random forest
                        K-nearest neighbor (KNN)
                        Support vector machine

Regression models:  (A method used for predictive modeling)

                        Linear regression
                        Ridge regression 
                        Decision trees
                        Random forest 
                        K-nearest neighbor (KNN)
                        Neural network regression


1. Linear regression            :a supervised machine learning technique used for predicting and forecasting values that fall within a continuous range, such as sales numbers or housing prices.
2. Logistic regression          :also known as "logit regression," is a supervised learning algorithm primarily used for binary classification tasks.
3. Naive Bayes                  :a set of supervised learning algorithms used to create predictive models for binary or multi-classification tasks.
4. Decision tree                :a supervised learning algorithm used for classification and predictive modeling tasks.
5. Random forest                : an ensemble of decision trees used for classification and predictive modeling.
6. K-nearest neighbor (KNN)     :a supervised learning algorithm commonly used for classification and predictive modeling tasks.
7.  K-means                     :an unsupervised algorithm commonly used for clustering and pattern recognition tasks
8. Support vector machine (SVM) :a supervised learning algorithm commonly used for classification and predictive modeling tasks.
9. Apriori                      :unsupervised learning algorithm used for predictive modeling
10. Gradient boosting           :algorithms employ an ensemble method, which means they create a series of "weak" models that are iteratively improved upon to form a strong predictive model.

Notes:    a decision tree is a common algorithm used for both classification and prediction modeling.
